ROdiomX is a free software and it can be shared and redistributed amongst different research users.
This software is shared and distributed among research communities to accelerate radiomic analysis as well as
supporting the goal of radiomic feature standardization based on the IBSI guidelines.

ROdiomX is an IBSI-validated software which has been developed under the MATLAB platform and is not designed
for use in clinic. The ROdiomX software is equipped with a DICOM RT structure reading module that employs the
Plastimatch-1.9.0 software. The Plastimatch software (https://gitlab.com/plastimatch/plastimatch/blob/master/src/plastimatch/LICENSE.TXT) 
is intended for research use only. It is an open source software for image computation in Radiation Therapy (RT) which can be used, modified, 
and distributed without cost under a BSD-style license.
